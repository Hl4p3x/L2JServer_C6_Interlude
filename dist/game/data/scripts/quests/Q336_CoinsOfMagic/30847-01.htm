I also became a level 1 member recently and so please do a good job on this.<br>
But what do you want to exchange? These are all the coins I have... And to exchange with me, you'll need <font color="LEVEL">blood succubus, blood basilisk, silver dryad, silver undine, gold giant and gold wyrms</font>. OK, choose one of my coins?<br>
