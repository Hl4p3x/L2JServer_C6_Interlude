<html><body>Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Sir Gustaf Athebaldt is an uncle of King Amadeo Cadmus. He is next in succession to the royal throne. He feigns a disinterest in politics to dispel people's suspicions, while in reality he controls many cliques which are undermining the power of the king.  He ulimately plans to seize the throne!  <BR>
The dragon eggs you have collected will be used to create his own private army of striders.  Even now Dwarven Artisans are completing the gigantic siege weapons he will use in the coup.<BR>
This is all I will say on the subject. Please go to Sir Gustaf Athebaldt.
