Ah, at last, the <FONT color="LEVEL">Scepter of Judgment</FONT>! It truly does exist! This is a great accomplishment... Sir Gustaf Athebaldt sends word that he would like for all of you to bring the scepter to him.  However, I must ask you something... Why are you allowing yourselves to be taken advantage of by someone like Sir Gustaf Athebaldt? My father has told me a lot about you and that's why I ask.  With your skills you can follow your own path. <BR>
