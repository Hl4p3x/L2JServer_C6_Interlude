I collect the eggs of wyrms and drakes to study them. I have spoken with experts in this field and feel qualified to do this study. Earlier I sent several Dwarven Bounty Hunters to <FONT color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</FONT> to collect eggs. It's been a week and still there is no word from them. I am afraid that this was too challenging a job for them. Please go to the valley and collect eggs for me. Please bring 10 each of <FONT color="LEVEL">Thunder Wyrm Eggs, Drake Eggs, Blitz Wyrm Eggs and Mist Drake Eggs</FONT>. Blitz Wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare and it will probably be quite difficult to find them. If you should happen to meet the Dwarves that I sent earlier, they may give you some hints. Good luck!
