<html><body>Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
History tells us again and again that ultimate power comes from superior technology. Therefore I have long supported the Black Anvil guild. Their mission is to research the ancient technology of the giants. They have not yet developed any practical applications of this technology, but it has amazing potential!<BR>There is a Dwarf in the guild named <FONT color="LEVEL">Balthazar</FONT> in whom I have invested much time and resources.  Although he is not well-known in Dwarven society, he is an amazing Artisan. I believe that his efforts will soon bear fruit. However, he has reached an impasse in his work and has requested my help. It has something to do with a new type of golem he is developing... He will tell you more when you see him. Take this letter amd find him in <FONT color="LEVEL">Hunters Village</FONT>.
