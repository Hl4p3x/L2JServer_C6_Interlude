Well, our time together has come to an end... I pray that one day your clan will become strong enough to establish peace on this continent. I look forward to that day. Now I bestow upon your clan the Proof of Aspiration.  Since the days of King Rauhel this honor has been given to promising young lords who dare to dream great dreams. Present this to High Priests and Grand Masters to receive help in strengthening your clan.
