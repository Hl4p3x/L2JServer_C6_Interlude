Hmm... These coins aren't from our guild! It appears that you've helped someone from the Black Anvil Guild! Well, we  Dwarves never forget a favor. I shall give you something that will be helpful to you. It's a <FONT color="LEVEL">recipe</FONT> for fixing a broken and otherwise useless titan powerstone. You will find it quite useful if you have a Dwarf in your group.  Good luck!
