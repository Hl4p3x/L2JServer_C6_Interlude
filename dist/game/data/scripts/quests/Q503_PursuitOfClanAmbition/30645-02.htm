I'm sure you have heard from Athebaldt of the awakening of the Land Dragon Antharas. Most people still have not accepted the horror of this reality. It is only a matter of time until the Land Dragon wakes up completely. When this happens, the wyrms and drakes of Dragon Valley will join their leader and assist Antharas in the utter destruction of this whole area.<BR>We must devise a plan to save Giran. A direct attack on the dragon would be fruitless. Indeed, the very idea of opposing Antharas with any conventional means is absurd. We must find a unique way to destroy the evil creatures of Antharas. Up to now our only response has been to shore up our defenses. Fortunately, Athebaldt has heard of our plight and  offered his assistance.<BR>
