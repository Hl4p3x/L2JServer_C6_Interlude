They are apostates and don't hesitate to dishonor our ancestors. These  Bounty Hunters dig up graves and rob them of whatever items they find of value. They are especially fond of shiny objects, and thus earned their moniker "the Magpie Brothers". They robbed the graves of ancient Dwarven kings in the labyrinth of Schuttgart and then shamelessly sold them to the highest bidder. The most holy relics of our race! They were banished from the kingdom for that. They came to the kingdom of Aden and stole the relics of the Elmoreden Empire from the National Cemetery... It is said that they have been searching for eggs in 
Dragon Valley at the behest of some Human royals...
