Will you join our research? We are investigation the use of Nebulite for the greater public good. However, we are having a hard time finding Nebilte for our study. The Dwarwen collectors we hired for this task have not been heard from in over a month.<br>
Would you do this work for us? Arround the crater of Ivory Tower you will find <font color="LEVEL">Manashen Gargoyles</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Monster Eyes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Stone Golems</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Iron Golems</font>. They have fallen under the spell of <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Orbs</font>, which are fragments of the meteorite. If you kill these monsters you can easily collect the Nebulite samples we need for our research.<br>
You shall be well-compensated for you efforts.<br>
