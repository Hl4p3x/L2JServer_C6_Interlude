<html><body>Magic Trader Cema:<br>
We need someone to gather materials for a research project that is being conducted at Harding's Academy. It is imperative that this person be cognizant of the forces of magic. If you know a well-trained Mystic, send him to me.<br>
(This quest can only be undertaken by non-orc Mistics level 40 and higher)
