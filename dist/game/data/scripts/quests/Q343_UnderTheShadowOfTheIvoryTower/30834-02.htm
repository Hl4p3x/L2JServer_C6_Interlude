It is well-known that the crater of the Ivory Tower was created by a gigantic meteorite... Hovewer, not many known that the meteorite was composed almost entirely of Nebulite and is currently locked away in the basement of the tower! Those in the Ivory Tower want to keep all Nebulite themselves!<br>
Does this seem fair? Should the source of the most powerful magical power on earth be monopolized by few privileged groups? I think not! That Nebulite should be used for the greater public good! Don't you agree?<br>
