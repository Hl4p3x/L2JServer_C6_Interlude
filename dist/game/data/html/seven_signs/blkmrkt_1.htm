Say, do you have any of those worthless old adenas? As a personal favor, I'll be happy to take them off your hands.<br>
Oh yes... if that special ability attached to your weapon is creating some kind of problem for you, I can even remove it. Personaly, I don't realy understand why in the world you'd want to remove it after what you went through to gain it in the first place, but mine is not to reason why. Just say the word and I'll take care of it.<br>
Other than that, we have some rare and unique things available for purchase here, so please have a look around. I must warn you, though -- there are hard-to-get items. I'd advise you buy whatever you can.<br>
