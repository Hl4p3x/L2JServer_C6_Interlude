# ----------------------------
#  Config BackLog
# ----------------------------
# Maximum length of request.
# The maximum length for incoming requests (connection request).
# Maximum number of requests, after which the requests
# Will not be accepted.
# The default is 50
# Must be equal to the estimated number of players.
# Example: Players in the game 1000 +, NetworkBackLog = 1000 
# NetworkBackLog = 50

# ----------------
#  Set TOS
# ----------------
# Set the traffic going to a particular socket.
# Can be ignored JAVA-machine.
# Range: 0 <= tc <= 255 or a ban happens.
# Note:
# To TCP4 should be set high priority and should be RFC 1349.
# You can also create a type priorities bit, example:
# IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
# IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
# IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
# IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)
# The lowest bit is ignored (0).
# Set bits in the priority may cause the collapse of the server.
# depends on the service and platform.
# Note:
# Applications can not change GameServer after connecting.
# To TCP6 value can be found in the header sin6_flowinfo.
# NetworkIpTOS = 0

#  Setting TCP_NODELAY

#  Setting KeepAlive
# -------------------------------
# On / Off SO_KEEPALIVE
#NetworkKeepAlive = False

# ------------------------
#  Set a timeout
# ------------------------
# Set a timeout in milliseconds.
# If set to 0, the timeout will be standard.
# Timeout must be greater than 0.
# Zero timeout is defined as an infinite timeout. 
#NetworkSoTimeOut = 0

# ---------------------------------------------------
#  Configure repetitions Adresses
# ---------------------------------------------------
# On / Off option.
# If the connection is closed, then turn timeout.

# Client Queue Configuration
# --------------------------
# Queue size, do not set it too low !
# Default: 14

# Maximum number of packets in burst.
# Execution will be aborted and thread released if more packets executed in raw.
# Default: 50
ClientPacketQueueMaxBurstSize = 50
# Maximum number of packets per second.
# Flood detector will be triggered if more packets received.
# After triggering all incoming packets will be dropped until flooding stopped.
# Default: 80
ClientPacketQueueMaxPacketsPerSecond = 80
# Average number of packets per second calculated during this interval.
# Using larger value decrease number of false kicks, but slower reaction to flood.
# Avoid using too low or too high values, recommended between 3 and 10.
# Default: 5
ClientPacketQueueMeasureInterval = 5
# Maximum average number of packets per second during measure interval.
# Flood detector will be triggered if more packets received.
# After triggering all incoming packets will be dropped until flooding stopped.
# Default: 40

# Maximum number of flood triggers per minute.
# Client will be kicked if more floods detected.
# Default: 2
ClientPacketQueueMaxFloodPerMin = 6
# Maximum number of queue overflows per minute.
# After overflow all incoming packets from client are dropped until queue is flushed.
# Client will be kicked if more queue overflows detected.
# Default: 50
ClientPacketQueueOverflowsPerMin = 50
# Maximum number of buffer underflows per minute.
# Client will be kicked if more underflow exceptions detected.
# Default: 1
ClientPacketQueueUnderflowsPerMin = 1
# Maximum number of unknown packets per minute.
# Client will be kicked if more unknown packets received.
# Default: 5
